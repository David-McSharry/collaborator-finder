Can teaching AI to understand cheating in games enhance its alignment with human values and intentions?\n3. How can the proposed training scheme influence the AI's capability to respond appropriately in scenarios where it has to differentiate between allowed and disallowed actions?\n\n**Methods:**\n1.

In the first stage, the AI is allowed to exploit artificial loopholes leading to easy victories without checks on legality, while receiving positive reinforcement for winning, even through cheating.\n3. The second stage introduces higher rewards for correct play but enforces negative feedback for illegal moves, pushing the AI to learn which actions are considered 'cheating.'\n4.
